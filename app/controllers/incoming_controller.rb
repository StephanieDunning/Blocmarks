   # Find the user by using params[:sender]
   # Find the topic by using params[:subject]
   # Assign the url to a variable after retreiving it from params["body-plain"]

   # Check if user is nil, if so, create and save a new user

   # Check if the topic is nil, if so, create and save a new topic

   # Now that you're sure you have a valid user and topic, build and save a new bookmark

  # Assuming all went well.
